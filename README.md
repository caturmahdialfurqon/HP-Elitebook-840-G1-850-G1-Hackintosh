# Hackintosh HP Elitebook 850 G1

Previously, this hack has run Macos Catalina and Bigsur With `Clover Bootloader`.

## NEW UPDATES at Mon. 7 Oct 2024

## Update to MONTEREY Final With `OC 1.0.1 EFI R001`

This laptop has been in the warehouse for a long time,`since 2021` üòÅ, I tried updating from MacOS Bigsur to Monterey with `OpenCore`, because I (a bit) forgot how to use "Clover" ü§£ hehe, I think it's better to move from "Clover" to "OpenCore" because it's easier to set up, in my opinion.

## I have tested the following features for Monterey With `OC 1.0.1 EFI R001`

`Monterey 12.7.4` upgrade applied without any issues. This hack is working perfectly. <br>
With SMBIOS `MacBookPro11,4`

## OLD POST ABOUT Hackintosh With Catalina on 2024 

ü§ñ I don't think there's even much to post about hackintosh on HP elitbook 850 G1, either on google search or on github specific to hackintosh HP elitbook 850 G1, therefore I want to create a repository of my experience of hackintosh in HP elitebook 850 g1 for 2 years. from me wearing highsierra,mojave to catalina for now, will probably try BigSur if there is already a stable version. hopefully it can help. ü§ñ

This is a detailed macOS Catalina 10.15.6 Vanilla install guide for HP Elitebook 850 G1 , based on [RehabMan's HP guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-hp-probook-elitebook-zbook-using-clover-uefi-hotpatch.261719/). [This guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) is also really useful.
